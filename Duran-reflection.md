What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was unclear about the difference between some Git commands, such as Pull and Fetch. I also didn't fully understand where and where not to clone a repo.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

James, our guide, was very helpful in clarifying when and where to clone a repo and reminded us to use good Git workflow by commiting often. The practice of creating and merging a pull request with a partner was also a helpful hands-on exercisee.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I tried to check in with my pair often, especially when I was navigating, to make sure we were on the same page. There were a few technical questions surrounding Github that I called on our guide to clarify. 

What still confuses you about Git?

I feel comfortable with basic Git workflow and am really starting to see how it will benefit my personal workflow. It is still occassionaly confusing to have the local copy of a repo and the Github copy be different. For example, when you delete a branch after merging a pull request on Github, it still exists in your local copy. 


How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I appreciated having a guide to call on with questions, but since it was my first GPS and I had a few questions about how to structure the session, I wish the guide had been more hands-on. He took mostly a backseat role, only stepping in if we were about to make a catastrophic error! It would have been nice to get a basic walkthrough of pairing since my partner and I were pretty inexperienced.
