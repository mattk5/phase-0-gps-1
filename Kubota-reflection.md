What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I understood the concepts and I felt that I just needed more repetition which I can do on the side and go through the material again.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

It was good to go through the concepts of working in GitHub with a partner which simulates what it would be like working with a group on projects. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

We had asked our guide a technical question dealing with an issue we ran into when uploading an image for one of the Releases. I had asked my pair a few questions dealing with programming terms, nothing too major. 

What still confuses you about Git?

Nothing. It was good to go through the steps in this way because it allows you to experience it in a way you're not used to or may not have the opportunity to everyday. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I was nervous since I didn't know what to expect. My worst fear was that I wouldn't be an efficient navigator when my turn came. It turned out fine and I got the feedback that I needed which I'll use in the next GPS that I'm a part of.
